    The JSON object should contain rules and preferences covering:
    - "tone": (e.g., "casual", "formal", "enthusiastic")
    - "greeting": (e.g., "prefers 'Hey' over 'Hi'")
    - "emojis": (e.g., "uses emojis like 'ðŸŒŸ' and 'ðŸš€'")
    - "phrasing": (e.g., "prefers shorter sentences", "avoids jargon")
    - "call_to_action": (e.g., "prefers open-ended questions like 'what are your thoughts?'")
