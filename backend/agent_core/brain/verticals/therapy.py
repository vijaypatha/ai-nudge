# FILE: backend/agent_core/brain/verticals/therapy.py
#
# PURPOSE:
# This file defines the specific AI logic and configuration for the 'Therapy' vertical.
# It tells the central Nudge Engine how to score events, what kind of campaigns to create,
# and how to display information in the UI, tailored specifically to a therapist's workflow.
#
# STRATEGIC DECISION:
# This implementation focuses entirely on the "Content Suggestion" feature. It replaces
# previous placeholder logic that required a non-existent calendar integration. This new
# approach delivers immediate user value by leveraging the Google Search API and the app's
# existing client tagging system, creating a powerful, proactive, and vertical-agnostic
# content discovery pipeline that can be extended to other verticals in the future.

    This is the core scoring logic for the therapy vertical. It determines if a specific
    client is a good match for a given event.

    For a 'content_suggestion' event, it performs a simple but powerful match:
    Does the topic of the content (e.g., "anxiety") match any of the tags
    associated with the client? These tags can be manually set by the therapist
    or automatically extracted by the AI from conversations, making the match highly relevant.
    This approach is HIPAA-safe as it does not analyze sensitive clinical notes.
